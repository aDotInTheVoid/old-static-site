      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again, when everyone is writing excellent summary articles about what happened this year, and goals for the next one. I figured I should do the same for rustdoc JSON.
What is rustdoc JSON? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, rustdoc JSON is an unstable feature for rustdoc that allows rustdoc to output a JSON description of a crates API, as opposed to the stable HTML output.</description>

Problem Statement I wanted to try to implement this in rust as something to do during quarantine. Doing so lead me down a rabbit whole of profiling, optimization and python performance, so I thought it was worth writing about.
Obviously, the first step was to see if someone had already done this someone else has. It turns out someone has, and that when that person is Peter Norvig, you should probably read it.</description>
